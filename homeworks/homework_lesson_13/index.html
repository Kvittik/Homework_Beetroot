            Welcome to the very start of your React Native journey! 
            If you're looking for environment setup instructions, 
            they've moved to their own section. Continue reading 
            for an introduction to the documentation, Native 
            Components, React, and more!

            React Native is an open source framework for building 
            Android and iOS applications using React and the app 
            platform‚Äôs native capabiles. With React Native, you 
            use JavaScript to access your platform‚Äôs APIs as well 
            as to describe the appearance and behavior of your UI 
            using React components: <span class="italic"> bundles of reusable, nestable 
            code</span>. You can learn more about React in the next section. 
            But first, let‚Äôs cover how components work in React Native.

                React Native runs on <span class="underline">React</span>, a 
                popular open source library for building user interfaces with 
                JavaScript. To make the most of React Native, it helps to 
                understand React itself. This section can get you started or 
                can serve as a refresher course.

                We‚Äôre going to cover the core concepts behind React:

            <p class="chapter_third_element"> <span class="element_bold">+ components.</span> 
                The rest of this introduction to React uses cats in its examples: friendly, 
                approachable creatures that need names and a cafe 
                to work in.
            </p>
            <p class="chapter_third_element">
                <span class="element_bold"> + JSX.</span> React and React Native use JSX, 
                a syntax that lets you write elements inside JavaScript like so: 
                <mark>&lt; Text &gt; Hello, I am your cat! &lt; Text &gt;</mark>.
            </p>
            <p class="chapter_third_element">

                The React docs have <span class="underline">a comprehensive guide to JSX </span> 
                you can refer to learn even more. Because JSX is JavaScript, you can use variables 
                inside it. Here you are declaring a <mark>name</mark> for the cat, name, 
                and embedding it with curly braces inside <mark>&lt; Text &gt;</mark> 
            </p>
            <p class="chapter_third_element">
                <span class="element_bold">+ props.</span> Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù. 
            </p>
            <p class="chapter_third_element">
                <span class="element_bold">+ state.</span> While you can think of props 
                as arguments you use to configure how components render, state is like a 
                component‚Äôs personal data storage. State is useful for handling data that 
                changes over time or that comes from user interaction. State gives your components memory!

            <p>
                TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It has an 
                <span class="italic">onChangeText</span> prop that takes a function to be called every time the text 
                changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that takes a function to be called 
                when the text is submitted.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating their 
                words into a different language. In this new language, every single word 
                is written the same way: üçï. So the sentence "Hello there Bob" would be 
                translated as "üçï üçï".
